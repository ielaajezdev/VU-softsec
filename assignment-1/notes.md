## Patterns

- passwords seem to have repeating pattern of one long, multi-word string
    - long string length seems to be 24 chars long and comes from the gutenberg dictionary
    - `grep`: `^.{6}:[a-zA-Z0-9]{24}$`
    - these strings are all lowercase
    - these strings consist of a 11 and 13-letter word concatenated
- uses variations on full names (such as password `valerie` for Valerie Johnson)
- uses alternative characters for common letters:
    - `\/\/` for W
    - `^` for A
    - `-|-` for T
    - `|\/|` for M
    - `*` for O
    - `0` for O
    - `}{` for H
    - `(` for C
    - `5` for S
    - `#` for ...
- uses seemingly random number combinations
