# notes
- return addr is 40 bytes behind the buffer, can be overwritten bc we can write 200 bytes in a 16-byte buffer
- stack canary is 24 bytes behind the buffer, need to brute-force byte by byte
    - can do, because process forks so safe quit with the same canary for every fork
- need to not point the return address to `admin_console` but a few operations later (the first `LEA`) to avoid going to the subtraction of 8 bytes from RSP (which will cause misalignment in the system() call)
