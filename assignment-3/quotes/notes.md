- add quote reads more than size of buffer
- can overflow quote buffer in `new_user_quote` to overflow return address. Ret addr is 0x428 = 1064 bytes after `quote` buffer and we can read 2048 bytes into this buffer
- libc base is given when `_REAL_LD_SHOW_AUXV` set to 1 in env
    - actually ld.so base, but subtract 0x1fc000 from this and you get libc base (from `info proc mappings`)
    - then use only libc for ropping
